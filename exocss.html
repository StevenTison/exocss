                Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,
                and other applied science.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
                flies to Mexico head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with high-yielding American bredd,
                creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer, It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
                subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receive the Nobel Of Piece Prize</li>

            <li><strong>2005</strong> - States "we will have to double the world food suply by 2050." Argues that
                geneticaly modified crop are the only way we can meet the demande, as we run out of aravle land. Says
                that the GM crios are not inherently dangerous because "we've been geneticaly modifying plants and
                animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.
